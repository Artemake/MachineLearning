    "**Artificial intelligence** is the study of agents that perceive the world around them, form plans, and make decisions to achieve their goals. Its foundations include mathematics, logic, philosophy, probability, linguistics, neuroscience, and decision theory. Many fields fall under the umbrella of AI, such as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.** Its goal is to enable computers to learn on their own. A machine’s learning algorithm enables it to identify patterns in observed data, build models that explain the world, and predict things without having explicit pre-programmed rules and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying AI, we wanted to build better and intelligent machines. But except for few mere tasks such as finding the shortest path between point A and B, we were unable to program more complex and constantly evolving challenges. **There was a realisation that the only way to be able to achieve this task was to let machine learn from itself.** This sounds similar to a child learning from its self. So machine learning was developed as a new capability for computers. And now machine learning is present in so many segments of technology, that we don’t even realise it while using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding patterns in data on planet earth is possible only for human brains. The data being very massive, the time taken to compute is increased, and this is where Machine Learning comes into action, to help people with large data in minimum time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If big data and cloud computing are gaining importance for their contributions, machine learning as technology helps analyse those big chunks of data, easing the task of data scientists in an automated process and gaining equal importance and recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The techniques we use for data mining have been around for many years, but they were not effective as they did not have the competitive power to run the algorithms. If you run deep learning with access to better data, the output we get will lead to dramatic breakthroughs which is machine learning.\n",

In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.\n",
